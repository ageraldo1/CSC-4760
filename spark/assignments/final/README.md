## **Final Exam**
### **Advanced Spark Project**
____


### **Instructions**
____
The goal is to create a Spark project in either Scala, or Python ( or a combination of the two that uses at least two of the advanced topics discussed in class:

+ Spark Streaming
+ Spark ML
+ GraphX / GraphDataframes
+ Spark SQL

For this project you can choose or create the problem in which you are solving yourself:
Use machine learning tool to analyze a stream of data or a group of data that exist on a file system like S3 or your local machine

+ Remember that you can actually set up a stream to S3, HDFS, a network enabled port on your local file system, or your Local File system.

+ You can model a graph of user relationship and try to find underlying information on the users in the network based on machine learning tool

+ You can create an SQL database and compare the same type of connections to if you had the information stored in graphs instead

+ You can use Spark ML to create an Image classifier and store the results in a SQL structure

+ Analyze Tweets and use Spark ML to classify users or analyze and categorize their tweets to find useful information

+ Analyze Stock Market Data you store in Spark SQL to make Spark ML predictions on future trends of the mark

To present this project all information needs to be stored and presented on a static password protected server-less website that is created using AWS tools S3, Lambda, and CloudFront.
Information that needs to be presented on this static site is the following:

+ Video of you presenting you project and analyzing your code.
 
+ An instruction set on how you created your server-less host for your site.

+ Link to a PDF describing your project.

+ Link to source code you used in your project.

+ Link to the source code you used for Lambda functions.
